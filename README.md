# üöó Self-Driving AI using CARLA Simulator

This repository contains a deep reinforcement learning agent designed to learn autonomous driving behavior within the CARLA simulation environment. It uses a custom environment wrapper and a convolutional neural network to process grayscale camera input and output steering decisions.

## üß† Project Overview

The project uses a **Discrete Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to train a car to drive autonomously by interpreting front-facing camera images and choosing from three discrete actions: **turn left**, **go straight**, or **turn right**.

The simulation environment is built on top of CARLA and integrates directly with a TensorFlow-based learning loop.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Files Included

### `car_environment.py`

* Wraps the CARLA simulator into a custom OpenAI Gym-like environment.
* Includes:

  * Collision sensor handling
  * RGB camera with real-time image preprocessing
  * Speed-based reward system
  * Cleaned-up actor management
* Images are converted to grayscale and downsampled for memory and speed efficiency.

### `train_model.py`

* Builds a CNN-based DQN agent using TensorFlow.
* Uses experience replay and a target network to stabilize learning.
* Includes:

  * Dynamic reward shaping
  * Early synchronization with the camera sensor
  * Efficient replay memory updates
  * Epsilon-greedy exploration
* Synchronization with the environment is improved to ensure clean image collection and proper episode resets.
